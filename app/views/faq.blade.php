	<p>What is FitMix?</p>
	<p>
		FitMix is an alternative to a gym membership. With FitMix, you get access to hundreds of different fitness classes in your city.<br />
		For $88 a month, FitMix members get to book up to 8 classes per month at any of our participating studios in the FitMix network. Just a couple of things to note:
		<br />1. FitMix members get access to the fitness studios'unfilled slots which sometimes means certain classes have limited capacity. We advice booking early or feel free
		to choose another nearby studio in our network. <br />
		2. You can visit any studio in the ClassPass network up to 3 times per membership cycle.
	</p>
	<p>
		How long is a FitMix membership cycle?<br />
		Each FitMix cycle is one month in length, and will automatically renew on the same day each month. For example, if you subscribe on Jan 1, your subscription wil
		renew on Feb 1.  Once your new month starts, you'll be able to keep taking your favorite classes (and also exploring new venues!) FitMix does NOT require an annual/long-term commitment.

	</p>

	<p>
		How many classes do I get with a FitMix membership?<br />

		You'll be able to take up to 8 classes each month for just $11 per class! You can visit any studio in the FitMix network up to 3 times per membership cycle (which is 1 month and you can visit the studio again for another 3 times next month).

		If a studio has multiple locations, can I take 3 classes per membership cycle at each location?
		If a studio has more than 1 location, members can go up to 3 times total across all its studios. This is the agreement that we have with all of our studios.

	</p>
	<p>
		How do I book a class?<br />
		Book a class by clicking on one of the venues, and then selecting the class you would like to attend. Press the"BOOK NOW"button next to the class and confirm your reservation, Easy Peasy! You will receive an email ticket which you can just flash to the studio when you get there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Can I make a last minute reservation?<br />
		Depending on the studios, the deadline to reserve is 2-24 hours in advance of class. If the deadline has passed, please reach out to us at booking@fitmix.com and
		we'd be happy to look into making the reservation for you on our end! Please do not call the studio to make bookings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Can I book a class on a date beyond my current cycle?<br />
		You can schedule classes beyond your current cycle. The classes will count towards class allotment for the cycle in which they fall.
		Please note, if your subscription is cancelled prior to the date of a class you have reserved, that reservation will be cancelled.
	</p>
	<p>
		Can I make a reservation for a friend using my FitMix membership?<br />
		FitMix is your own personal, all-access pass to some of the most amazing fitness studios around. When you make a reservation through your account, your own name will show up on the class roster at all of our venues, so they'll be expecting to see you! While FitMix is non-transferable, we know how fun it is to take classes with friends and would definitely recommend buying a month on FitMix for one of your friends as a gift.
	</p>
	<p>
		What is the class cancellation policy?<br />
		All reservations and cancellations must be made at least 6 hours before the class time. Missed classes or late cancellations will result in the loss of a class from your FitMix account. We hate having this rule, and want to help you avoid it!.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're not going to be able to make a class, please make sure you do one of the following:<br />
		1. Cancel the class via your FitMix account page at least 6 hours in advance<br />
		2. If you are not able to log in to your account, just email booking@fitmix.com and we'll take care of it for you!

	</p>
	<p>
		By canceling a reservation in advance, the studio is able to give your spot to someone else.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		The class I want to take is sold out - what should I do?<br />
		There are a finite number of spaces in each class so we recommend planning early and booking ahead of time to make sure you can get into the class and time you want. Unfortunately we do not have a waiting list feature at this time. If the class you want is sold out, please email us at booking@fitmix.com and we'll give you a tailored list of studio recommendations based on your preferences!
	</p>
	<p>
		Are all of the classes at a studio available to book through FitMix?<br />
		We offer schedules for the majority of our studios, but occasionally studios reserve certain class times only for their members. We are always adding more classes 
and studios though to make sure there are spots available for all our users!
